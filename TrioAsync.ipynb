On line 17, we use trio.open_nursery() to get a “nursery” object, and then inside the async with block we call nursery.start_soon twice, on lines 19 and 22. There are actually two ways to call an async function: the first one is the one we already saw, using await async_fn(); the new one is nursery.start_soon(async_fn): it asks Trio to start running this async function, but then returns immediately without waiting for the function to finish. So after our two calls to nursery.start_soon, child1 and child2 are now running in the background. And then at line 25, the commented line, we hit the end of the async with block, and the nursery’s __aexit__ function runs. What this does is force parent to stop here and wait for all the children in the nursery to exit. This is why you have to use async with to get a nursery: it gives us a way to make sure that the child calls can’t run away and get lost. One reason this is important is that if there’s a bug or other problem in one of the children, and it raises an exception, then it lets us propagate that exception into the parent; in many other frameworks, exceptions like this are just discarded. **Trio never discards exceptions.**\""
